# AOC 2021 in Rust

## Day 1
easy
## Day 2
easy
## Day 3
easy
## Day 4
I got the nalgebra idea from reddit, I was trying to figure out a nice standard way to implement 2d space. Nalgebra was it.
## Day 5
I couldn't figure out why my solution wasn't working. I checked reddit solutions and still nothing. Turns out I was mixing up my directions...
## Day 6
My solution was too slow. Reddit has a great hashmap solution. I learned a lot.
## Day 7
I'm actually pretty proud of this one. Worked like a charm, but a bit slow...
## Day 8
Blazingly fast rust. It's a huge mess though... But it is fast.
## Day 9
Got some help from reddit to learn about VecDeque
## Day 10
Once I tried using a stack it was easy...
## Day 11
I kind of hated this one...
## Day 12
I really struggle with graph/search algorithms... I had the right idea, but just no way to implement it.
I went back and re-did day 12 again to understand graph/search better. I'm sort of getting it...
## Day 13
Nice and easy. The test folds exactly in half, but the input doesn't, so it took two tries
## Day 14
Improved the speed with a hashmap.
## Day 15
Part 1 was pretty easy. Part 2 my solution is too slow (like hours...) Need to revisit.
## Day 16
Nice one. I saw a great solution using bit streams... mine's not as clever.
## Day 17
Part 1... found that a guy did it in his head...
Need to remember that 1+2+3+..+n = n(n+1) / 2
